# What is Xomi?

**Xomi** ("show me" or "so me"; stylized **áºŠ**) is intended to be a federated art gallery.

# Federation?

Federation means that it works with other instances running Xomi.  Think of email:  a gmail user can email a hotmail user and it *just works*.  [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) is another famous example of federated software.  You can also host your own instance and follow profiles on other instances.

# Setup

Setup currently assumes an Ubuntu 16.06 box.  After a fresh install:

- `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/almafeta/xomi/master/setup.sh`
- `chmod 764 setup.sh`
- `sudo ./setup.sh`

Enter your password and let it run.

Once set up, it won't do terribly much yet, since it's still pre-MVP.
